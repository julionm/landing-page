I'll let these things here so I remember how I've done so far.

- [x] choose a new font for titles and call to action buttons
  - I ended up not needing I learned more about visual hierarchy, more than one font is cool but it looks easy to get it wrong
- [x] choose the primary color for the website and use it
- [x] add a Contact Me button in header (this should lead to a contact form or make one show up on a dialog)
  - Sort of done, I'm not adding a form but I'll give all information needed to someone reach me easily
- [x] animate the header
  - Kind of removed it... so there's no more header to animate
