# Landing Page

My landing page with some basic information: past experiences, interests, past projects, etc.

## Notes

- Buttons and Links don't fit in a single component (they could in a different project)

## ToDo

- [ ] make projects part the most correct as possible (add more projects)
- [-] make buttons work (both links and normal buttons)
- [ ] make projects work for mobile 
- [ ] find a way to show my email
- [ ] normalize a single class for titles
- [ ] make last updates work
  - [ ] make it work for mobile devices
  - [ ] make it actually work, create a new page to show the content, or maybe just use it as short update messages
- [ ] discover a way to make the site stand out more, today it looks really similar to everything else
  - I had an idea for this but it'll only work after 90% of the site is finished
- [ ] `BUG`: disable hover cards when scrolling starts
  - this may be solved by adding a context that'll say if the user is scrolling (this could be used for some animations or other interactions too)
- [ ] check if a section Interests makes any sense
- [ ] add a specific Update for LeetCodes I finish
