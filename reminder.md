I'll let these things here so I remember how I've done so far.

- [x] choose a new font for titles and call to action buttons
  - I ended up not needing I learned more about visual hierarchy, more than one font is cool but it looks easy to get it wrong
- [x] choose the primary color for the website and use it
- [x] add a Contact Me button in header (this should lead to a contact form or make one show up on a dialog)
  - Sort of done, I'm not adding a form but I'll give all information needed to someone reach me easily
- [x] animate the header
  - Kind of removed it... so there's no more header to animate
- [x] redo the projects part 
  - I did change things there, but it's okay now
- [x] design new sections
  - designed the latest Last Updates section
- [x] rewrite introduction text on header
- [x] make projects part the most correct as possible (add more projects)
- [x] create a shared class for all titles so it'll be easier to change on the rundown
- [x] create new project section
- [x] add action to the project cards
- [x] normalize a single class for titles
- [x] check if a section Interests makes any sense
  - No it doesn't I can show this via the site style (I don't know what exactly to use, but maybe some cool icons and/or svgs)
- [x] make last updates work
  - [x] make it work for mobile devices
- [x] `BUG`: After opening a project dialog you can't click on the same card again. It doesn't trigger a new event
- [x] make buttons work (both links and normal buttons)
- [x] add a specific Update for LeetCodes I finish
- [x] try to do that little hover thing on social media icons in Home
  - tried but it didn't work the way I expected, I'll find something else to do there
- [x] download the fonts and use it
- [x] Add a footer to the site
- [x] design an personal achievments/records/statistics
- [x] add option to select language
- [x] add option to change theme
- [x] find a way to show my email
- [x] make a tag list component that arranges tags inline
  - Maybe make the TagList component with the shared style among all the other components
- [x] hover on modal image increases the padding to image 3:4
- [x] text in modal for light theme
- [x] make Updates actually work, create a new page to show the content, or maybe just use it as short update messages
  - I don't know yet what to do with this section so I'll leave as it is for now
  - Nah, I'll use the updates to link to my LinkedIn posts and LeetCode solutions, that'll be good enough
- [x] translate the entire website to pt-BR
