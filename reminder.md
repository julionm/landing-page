I'll let these things here so I remember how I've done so far.

- [x] choose a new font for titles and call to action buttons
  - I ended up not needing I learned more about visual hierarchy, more than one font is cool but it looks easy to get it wrong
- [x] choose the primary color for the website and use it
- [x] add a Contact Me button in header (this should lead to a contact form or make one show up on a dialog)
  - Sort of done, I'm not adding a form but I'll give all information needed to someone reach me easily
- [x] animate the header
  - Kind of removed it... so there's no more header to animate
- [x] redo the projects part 
  - I did change things there, but it's okay now
- [x] design new sections
  - designed the latest Last Updates section
- [x] rewrite introduction text on header
- [x] make projects part the most correct as possible (add more projects)
- [x] create a shared class for all titles so it'll be easier to change on the rundown
- [x] create new project section
- [x] add action to the project cards
- [x] normalize a single class for titles
- [x] check if a section Interests makes any sense
  - No it doesn't I can show this via the site style (I don't know what exactly to use, but maybe some cool icons and/or svgs)
- [x] make last updates work
  - [x] make it work for mobile devices
- [x] `BUG`: After opening a project dialog you can't click on the same card again. It doesn't trigger a new event
