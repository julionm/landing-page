# Landing Page

My landing page with some basic information: experiences, interests, projects, etc.

## Notes

- Buttons and Links don't fit in a single component (they could in a different project)

## ToDo

- [ ] add utility to the primary buttons
  - [ ] Download resume
  - [x] read More buttons on article
- [ ] add true photos to the website to prepare for launch
  - [ ] projects
  - [x] achievments
- [ ] address accessibility issues
- [ ] improve lighthouse score
- [ ] parametrize spacing between sections
  - [ ] make it change based on screen size

After v1 being published:
- [ ] read material guidelines on text
- [ ] improve text
- [ ] add some effect to those social media buttons to show my usernames
  - dunno if I want this


## Blocked

- [-] `BUG`: disable hover cards when scrolling starts
  - this may be solved by adding a context that'll say if the user is scrolling (this could be used for some animations or other interactions too)
