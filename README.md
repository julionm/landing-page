# Landing Page

My landing page with some basic information: experiences, interests, projects, etc.

## Notes

- Buttons and Links don't fit in a single component (they could in a different project)

## ToDo

- [ ] make header active state depending on which section is the most visible
- [ ] translate Present on dates
- [ ] fix header in mobile
- [ ] think on a solution to fix dates across the website
- [ ] parametrize spacing between sections
  - [ ] make it change based on screen size
- [ ] read material guidelines on text
- [ ] add true photos to the website to prepare for launch
  - [ ] projects
  - [ ] achievments
- [ ] add utility to the primary buttons
- [ ] add some effect to those social media buttons to show my usernames
  - dunno if I want this


## Blocked

- [-] `BUG`: disable hover cards when scrolling starts
  - this may be solved by adding a context that'll say if the user is scrolling (this could be used for some animations or other interactions too)
