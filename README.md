# Landing Page

My landing page with some basic information: experiences, interests, projects, etc.

## Notes

- Buttons and Links don't fit in a single component (they could in a different project)

## ToDo

- [ ] `BUG`: After opening a project dialog you can't click on the same card again. It doesn't trigger a new event
- [ ] make buttons work (both links and normal buttons)
- [ ] make a tag list component that arranges tags inline
- [ ] find a way to show my email
- [ ] make last updates work
  - [ ] make it work for mobile devices
  - [ ] make it actually work, create a new page to show the content, or maybe just use it as short update messages
- [ ] make the Download Resume actually download my resume
- [ ] discover a way to make the site stand out more, today it looks really similar to everything else
  - I had an idea for this but it'll only work after 90% of the site is finished
- [ ] `BUG`: disable hover cards when scrolling starts
  - this may be solved by adding a context that'll say if the user is scrolling (this could be used for some animations or other interactions too)
- [ ] add a specific Update for LeetCodes I finish
- [ ] DEAL WITH IMAGES FOR PROJECTS AND OTHER STUFF
- [ ] Add a footer to the site
