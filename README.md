# Landing Page

My landing page with some basic information: experiences, interests, projects, etc.

## Notes

- Buttons and Links don't fit in a single component (they could in a different project)

## ToDo

- [ ] hover on modal image increases the padding to image 3:4
- [ ] text in modal for light theme
- [ ] implement animations or some creative stuff for the website
- [ ] add true photos to the website to prepare for launch
  - [ ] projects
  - [ ] achievments
- [ ] add utility to the primary buttons
- [-] make Updates actually work, create a new page to show the content, or maybe just use it as short update messages
  - I don't know yet what to do with this section so I'll leave as it is for now
  - Nah, I'll use the updates to link to my LinkedIn posts and LeetCode solutions, that'll be good enough
- [ ] discover a way to make the site stand out more, today it looks really similar to everything else
  - I had an idea for this but it'll only work after 90% of the site is finished
- [ ] add some effect to those social media buttons to show my usernames
  - dunno if I want this


## Blocked

- [-] `BUG`: disable hover cards when scrolling starts
  - this may be solved by adding a context that'll say if the user is scrolling (this could be used for some animations or other interactions too)
